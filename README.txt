This is an attempt to create a second version of my website updated to my current wants.

1. Using a framework meant for more complex projects when all I needed was a light one.
My website was never intended to be complicated, but I had initially chosen Django as I wanted to challenge
myself a little more by learning a more complex framework.  Although I don't regret this, at the current
point in my career I'm already very familiar with Spring Boot and some of the concepts involved in these
more complicated frameworks.  I'd rather save the time and use a lighter weight framework like flask or express.js.

2. Deploying on my previous project was annoying.  Having to ssh in, stop the server, pull the changes,
migrate the static files if changes were made, and restart the server was too much effort for a side
project like this when there are other things I want/need to be doing.
With this project I have a few ideas for ways to mitigate this.
a. Moving my Resume to be a google drive link
b. Create a stop, update, and restart script to improve this.

3. Improve the front end.  My front end was trash.  I'm a BE developer, but I should spend some time here
to make this look better and add some additional content.
