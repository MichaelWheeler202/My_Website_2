            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <a>
                I'm a Software Developer from Michigan that has been working in development roles since 2019. These roles have included back end, fullstack, and database developer positions.
                My strength and interest is mainly in back end development where I have the opportunity to create solutions for performance issues and learn more about application architecture.
                I also have an interest in machine learning and the problems it can solve.
